                <h2>What is space?</h2>
                <p>From the perspective of an Earthling, outer space is a zone
                that occurs about 100 kilometers (60 miles) above the planet,
                where there is no appreciable air to breathe or to scatter
                light. In that area, blue gives way to black because oxygen
                molecules are not in enough abundance to make the sky blue.
                Further, space is a vacuum, meaning that sound cannot carry
                because molecules are not close enough together to transmit
                sound between them. That's not to say that space is empty,
                however. Gas, dust and other bits of matter float around
                "emptier" areas of the universe, while more crowded regions can
                host planets, stars and galaxies.</p>
                <p>No one knows exactly how big space is. The difficulty arises
                because of what we can see in our detectors. We measure long
                distances in space in "light-years," representing the distance
                it takes for light to travel in a year (roughly 5.8 trillion
                miles, or 9.3 trillion kilometers). From light that is visible
                in our telescopes, we have charted galaxies reaching almost as
                far back as the Big Bang, which is thought to have started our
                universe 13.7 billion years ago. This means we can "see" into
                space at a distance of almost 13.7 billion light-years.
                However, astronomers are not sure if our universe is the only
                universe that exists. This means that space could be a lot
                bigger than it appears to us.</p>
                <p>Radiation invisible to human eyes Most of space is
                relatively empty, meaning that there are just stray bits of
                dust and gas inside of it. This means that when humans send a
                satellite to a distant planet, the object will not encounter
                "drag" in the same way that an airplane does as it sails
                through space. The vacuum environment in space and on the moon,
                for example, is one reason that the lunar lander of the Apollo
                program looks so odd-shaped — like a spider, one crew said.
                Because the spacecraft was designed to work in a zone with no
                atmosphere, there was no need for smooth edges or an
                aerodynamic shape.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="w3-third w3-justify">
                <p>While space may look empty to human eyes, research has shown
                that there are forms of radiation emanating through the cosmos.
                In our own solar system, the solar wind — made up of plasma and
                other particles from the sun — permeates past the planets and
                occasionally causes aurora near the Earth's poles. Cosmic rays
                also fly through the neighborhood, emanating from supernovas
                outside of the solar system. In fact, the universe is permeated
                with the cosmic microwave background, which can be understood
                as the leftovers of the immense explosion that formed our
                cosmos (usually called the Big Bang). The CMB, which is best
                seen in microwaves, shows the earliest radiation that our
                instruments can detect. [Infographic: Cosmic Microwave
                Background Explained]</p>
                <p>One large feature of space that is poorly seen or understood
                is the supposed presence of dark matter and dark energy, which
                are essentially forms of matter and energy that can only be
                detected through their effects on other objects. Since the
                universe is expanding and accelerating in that expansion, that
                is seen as one key piece of evidence for dark matter. Another
                is gravitational lensing that occurs when light "bends" around
                a star from a distant background object.</p>
                <p>Smaller black holes can form from the gravitational collapse
                of a gigantic star, which forms a singularity from which
                nothing can escape — not even light, hence the name of the
                object. No one is quite sure what lies within a black hole, or
                what would happen to a person or object who fell into it – but
                research is ongoing. An example is gravitational waves, or
                ripples in space-time that come from interactions between black
                holes. This was first predicted by Albert Einstein at the turn
                of the last century, when he showed that time and space are
                linked; time speeds up or slows down when space is distorted.
                As of mid-2017, the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave
                Observatory (LIGO) Scientific Collaboration has announced three
                black-hole interactions and mergers detected through
                gravitational waves, in just two years.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="w3-third w3-justify">
                <h2>Very New News!</h2>
                <p>The team found these three events in about two years,
                indicating that when LIGO is implemented at full sensitivity,
                the observatory may be able to find these sorts of events
                frequently, scientists said in May 2017. Should a bunch of
                these black hole events be detected, it could help scientists
                learn how black holes of a certain size (several tens of sun
                masses) are born, and later merge into new black holes.</p>
                <p>Stars (like our own sun) are immense balls of gas that
                produce their own radiation. They can range from red
                supergiants to cooling white dwarfs that are the leftovers of
                supernovas, or star explosions that occur when a big one runs
                out of gas to burn. These explosions spread elements throughout
                the universe and are the reason that elements such as iron
                exist. Star explosions can also give rise to incredibly dense
                objects called neutron stars. If these neutron stars send out
                pulses of radiation, they are called pulsar stars.</p>
                <p>Planets are objects whose definition came under scrutiny in
                2006, when astronomers were debating whether Pluto could be
                considered a planet or not. At the time, the International
                Astronomical Union (the governing body on Earth for these
                decisions) ruled that a planet is a celestial body that orbits
                the sun, is massive enough to have a nearly round shape, and
                has cleared its orbit of debris. Under this designation, Pluto
                and similar small objects are considered "dwarf planets,"
                although not everyone agrees with the designation. After the
                New Horizons spacecraft flew by Pluto in 2015, principal
                investigator Alan Stern and others again opened up the debate,
                saying the diversity of terrain on Pluto makes it more like a
                planet.</p>
